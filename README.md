# Linked-List-Project
Made a small IMDb database using linked lists. Main focus is on mastering the data structure.
The main.cpp file contains all of the code. Project was done in CLion so if you're using CLion just open the project folder in it.
If you're on some other IDE and the code does not compile you can always try the good old copy and paste.
If file fails to open try giving the absolute path.
